# RoomPal
Application for students to find compatible roommate for their freshmen year

---

## Description

Hate living with someone you know nothing about and have never seen before? 
We all have struggled to find a good roommate for upcoming school year, ending up living with a random person assigned through
school's matching algorithm.
This can be frustrating for people who have never lived with someone before or has no experience about their culture.

Solution?
RoomPal is an application where students can meet different people from different area's based on their personality and preferences.
